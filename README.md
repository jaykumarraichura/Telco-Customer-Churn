# Telcommunication Customer Churn Rate Model

Customer churn is a critical challenge for the telecommunications industry. It refers to the loss of customers who switch from one telecom operator to another. The ability to predict customer churn in advance—such as determining whether a customer is likely to leave within the next several months—enables telecom companies to implement targeted marketing strategies to retain customers and strengthen their customer base. Given the scale of the industry, even a 1% reduction in churn rates can result in substantial revenue growth.

Churn analysis encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of customer behavior, product or service usage, and the likelihood of attrition. The primary objective is to identify at-risk customers—often before they themselves are aware of their likelihood to leave—and take proactive measures to retain them.

The Telco churn dataset represents a hypothetical telecommunications company providing home phone and internet services to 500,000 customers in California during the third quarter. The dataset captures customer retention patterns, indicating which customers have remained, switched providers, or newly subscribed to the service.
