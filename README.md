# Telcommunication Customer Churn Rate Model

Customer churn is a critical challenge for the telecommunications industry. It refers to the loss of customers who switch from one telecom operator to another. The ability to predict customer churn in advance—such as determining whether a customer is likely to leave within the next several months—enables telecom companies to implement targeted marketing strategies to retain customers and strengthen their customer base. Given the scale of the industry, even a 1% reduction in churn rates can result in substantial revenue growth.

Churn analysis encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of customer behavior, product or service usage, and the likelihood of attrition. The primary objective is to identify at-risk customers—often before they themselves are aware of their likelihood to leave—and take proactive measures to retain them.

## Research Objective

Developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn is crucial for improving customer retention and business performance. The objective of this project is to build a predictive model capable of identifying customers who are likely to leave the company. Before model development, thorough data analysis and feature engineering must be conducted to ensure optimal model performance.

This project utilizes the Telcommunication Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. Each row represents an individual customer, while each column contains specific customer attributes. The dataset comprises 21 variables and 500,000 customer records (OUT OF WHICH 450,000 RECORDS WERE CREATED AS A DUMMY ROWS USING DATABRICKS TO EXPAND OUR DATA AND REDUCE ANY OUTLIER ERROR), including details such as customer ID, gender, phone service, and internet service. As shown in Table 1, the dataset consists of 17 categorical variables and 4 numerical variables, providing a comprehensive foundation for churn prediction analysis.

## Data Summary

The Telcommunication churn dataset represents a HYPOTHETICAL telecommunications company providing home phone and internet services to 500,000 customers in California during the third quarter. The dataset captures customer retention patterns, indicating which customers have remained, switched providers, or newly subscribed to the service.
